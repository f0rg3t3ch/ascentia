# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

A one-page static site for **Ascentia Education**, an education centre in Supetar on the island of Brač,
Croatia. It is built **twice, once per language** — `/` in Croatian and `/en/` in English — from one set of
components and two dictionaries.

**This is a first draft that the client has not seen yet.** Expect the copy, the sections and the look to
change. Read "What's real, what's a draft" before writing any content.

It is a sibling of `word-and-rijec-dot-com`, `guy-catz-dot-com` and `veli-bol-home` (currently under
`~/repositories/xarlos89@github.com/`) and was ported from the first of those. When something here is
unclear, `word-and-rijec-dot-com` and its `CLAUDE.md` are the reference.

## Commands

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh   # a non-interactive shell otherwise finds apt's Node 18
npm install
npm run dev      # Vite dev server, http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # prerender both pages to dist/ via vite-react-ssg
npm run preview  # serve the built dist/
```

No tests, linter or typechecker. `npm run build` is the only gate: it prerenders both pages, so a runtime
error or a mismatch between the two dictionaries fails the build.

## Stack and layout

React 18, Vite 5 (`base: './'`), `vite-react-ssg`, Tailwind 3, react-router-dom (as a build-time page list
only). No backend, no analytics, no form.

```
index.html              <head>: only what is identical in both languages, incl. the pre-launch noindex
src/
  main.jsx              vite-react-ssg entry + runtime basename detection
  routes.jsx            one route per language
  App.jsx               the page: Hero, Programmes, Learning, Contact, Footer
  siteInfo.js           language-independent facts: name, phone, email, address, canonical origin
  i18n/locales.js       locale table and the relative-path maths
  i18n/hr.js  en.js     every user-visible string
  i18n/index.jsx        <LangProvider>, useLang(), the same-shape assertion
  images.js             asset() / responsivePhoto() — use the bound copies off useLang()
  components/           Navbar, Footer, LangSwitch, Wordmark, PuzzlePiece, Photo, Reveal, Seo
  sections/             Hero, Programmes, Learning, Contact
public/                 fonts, images, icons, og.jpg, robots, sitemap, 404
```

## Two languages

| URL | file | `<html lang>` | dictionary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | `dist/index.html` | `hr` | `src/i18n/hr.js` |
| `/en/` | `dist/en/index.html` | `en` | `src/i18n/en.js` |

Croatian is the root and `x-default`: the centre serves local families first.

- **The language comes from the route, never from state.** No toggle state, no `localStorage`.
- **No user-visible text in a component.** Put it in both dictionaries under the same key and read it with
  `const { t } = useLang()`. `src/i18n/index.jsx` asserts the two have identical shapes and throws during
  the build, naming the key. The one exception is `hero.slogan` (listed in `FREE_LENGTH`), which is split
  into colour chunks and has five in Croatian to six in English.
- **`<LangSwitch>`** shows both languages, `HR | EN`, with the current one filled. It is in the navbar at
  every width and again in the footer. Its links are plain `<a>`s: changing language loads the other
  document.

### Relative paths — the two traps

`base: './'` lets one build run at a domain root and under `f0rg3t3ch.github.io/ascentia/`. It has two
consequences:

1. **Assets from a page one directory down.** `./assets/x` inside `/en/index.html` resolves to
   `/en/assets/x`. The `onPageRendered` hook in `vite.config.js` rewrites what Vite emits; our own
   references go through `asset()` / `responsivePhoto()` **taken off `useLang()`**, and the switcher uses
   `localeHref()`. Never write a root-relative `/en/` or `/images/…`.
2. **The router under a sub-path.** react-router matches the full pathname, and `/ascentia/` is not a
   route, so without help the prerendered page is replaced by "404 Not Found" on hydration.
   `detectBasename()` in `src/main.jsx` works the mount point out from the address bar. `npm run preview`
   serves at `/` and will not show this bug — to test it, serve `dist/` from a directory named `ascentia`
   one level up (`python3 -m http.server`) and open `/ascentia/` and `/ascentia/en/`.

## Brand

Everything comes from the client's own social-media posters (peach ground, teal brush wordmark, puzzle
pieces, a word-per-colour slogan). The hex values were sampled from those images.

| token | hex | use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `peach` | `#F7D2BF` | the main ground |
| `sage` | `#A9C9A2` | the alternate ground |
| `teal` / `teal-deep` | `#1C84A4` / `#0F5F78` | the wordmark colour / headings, buttons, links |
| `mauve`, `sun` | `#B88CA0`, `#F4C442` | puzzle pieces, badges, accents — fills only |
| `berry` | `#B85884` | the "Learn Croatian and English!" headline (large type only) |
| `sage-deep`, `mauve-deep`, `sun-deep` | see `tailwind.config.js` | the slogan words; the poster tones are too pale to read as type on peach |
| `cream` | `#FFF8F2` | cards and the navbar pill |
| `ink` / `ink-soft` | `#23343B` / `#3F5058` | body type |

`teal` is only about 3:1 on peach, and `teal-deep` about 4:1 on sage: both are for large type. Body text is
`ink`. The posters set white text on peach; the site does not, because it cannot be read. These ratios
were worked out by hand, not with a tool — re-check them before adding a colour for type.

**Type.** Fredoka (variable, 300–700) for headings, Poppins for body — **only Poppins 400 and 600 are
shipped**, so use `font-normal` or `font-semibold` and nothing else on body type. Each face is two files,
`-latin` and `-latin-ext`; the latin-ext half carries č ć š ž đ and must never be dropped.

### The logo

No vector logo exists yet. `public/images/ascentia-wordmark.webp` is the brush wordmark **keyed out of a
poster JPEG** (800px wide, transparent), and `<Wordmark lockup>` sets the "— EDUCATION —" line under it in
HTML. `public/og.jpg` is a crop of the full logo poster. `public/favicon.svg` and `<PuzzlePiece>` share one
hand-drawn path, and the PNG icons were rendered from that SVG. **Ask the client for the real logo files**
and replace all of these.

## Deployment

Push to `main` → `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds and publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages at
**https://f0rg3t3ch.github.io/ascentia/**. There is no custom domain and no `public/CNAME` yet.

The origin is typed out in four places that have to change together: `src/siteInfo.js` (`site.url`),
`public/sitemap.xml`, `public/robots.txt` and `public/404.html`.

### Launch checklist

The site is deliberately hidden from search until the client approves it.

1. Remove `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, follow">` from `index.html`. (`robots.txt` already allows
   crawling — it has to, or Google never sees the noindex.)
2. If there is a domain: add `public/CNAME`, set the DNS records for GitHub Pages, and change the origin in
   the four places above.
3. Verify the property in Google Search Console (a Domain property by DNS TXT, as on the sibling sites) and
   submit `sitemap.xml`.
4. Bump both `<lastmod>` values in `public/sitemap.xml`.

## What's real, what's a draft

**From the client's posters, verbatim:**

- The name, the slogan "Small steps also reach big goals", "Learning through play, creativity, and
  exploration", "Join us – let's grow, learn, and play together!", "Enrolling now!", "Ages 4–6".
- "Learn Croatian and English!" with the For kids / For adults points.
- `learning.items` (Emotional literacy; Empathy and belonging) — **in both languages**. This is the only
  Croatian on the site that is her own.
- The hero photo, the palette and the wordmark.

**From her posters but not yet confirmed for the website:**

- Phone `+385 98 182 1274`, email `edu.ascentia@gmail.com`, address `Mirka Kustića 2, Supetar`. The two
  posters group the phone digits differently; the digits are the same.
- "Enrolling now!" is time-sensitive — ask whether it still holds.

**Drafted here, not hers — she must review all of it:**

- **Every Croatian string except `learning.items`**: the slogan (`I mali koraci vode do velikih ciljeva`),
  the hero lead, everything under `programmes`, `contact.heading`/`sub`, the meta description. These are
  translations of her English poster text.
- UI chrome in both languages: nav labels, the section headings "Programmes" and "What children learn",
  button text, alt text, the meta descriptions.

**Not on the site because nobody has supplied it:** prices, schedules, opening hours, staff names or bios,
testimonials, social links, a contact form, a map.

`public/images/portrait-{400,700,1100}.webp` is a portrait the client sent. It is **not used on the page**
— who it shows has not been confirmed, and an About section needs a name and a bio from her — but anything
in `public/` is published, so it is reachable by URL once the site is deployed.

### Don't invent

Use only what the client sends. If a section has no real content, leave it out rather than writing
plausible filler — a page that says less is recoverable, one that says something untrue about her business
is not. When she supplies Croatian wording, use hers and do not polish it.
