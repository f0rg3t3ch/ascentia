     * `base: './'` makes Vite emit document-relative URLs — './assets/app.js',
     * './fonts/…', './favicon.svg'. That is correct for dist/index.html and
     * wrong for dist/en/index.html, where './assets/app.js' resolves to
     * /en/assets/app.js and 404s. vite-react-ssg writes the same template to
     * both depths and does not rewrite them.
     *
     * So: for every page one or more directories down, walk the prefix back
     * up. Only href/src attribute values that literally start './' are
     * touched. The mirror of this for assets OUR code references out of
     * public/ is assetPrefix() in src/i18n/locales.js.
